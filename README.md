# Component-Based-Programming

## COSC 2329 Spring 2018

This was one of the earliest weed-out courses after the intro CS courses and before `COSC 3327 - Algorithms and Data Structures`. We had six 'challenges' designed to teach us about debugging, implementing static utility methods from an interface, implementing constructors with varying parameters for a few different internal representations, asserts, and implementing an interface completely with a multitude of internal representations. 

The course was designed to make us think critically about these topics and to make us better programmers who can handle a multitude of issues in more than one way.
