# CH I - Debugging

In challenge I, my professor tested us to see if we could use the debugger on a skeleton program to find and fix a few errors, and then step through the given program to find out the values of variables at specific iterations. We were tasked to take screenshots to answer questions 2-5 and have enough information in the screenshot to prove we were correct.

The questions were as follows: 

1. Why does nothing print to the console? (No screenshot necessary, just resolve)
2. What are the very first values for random_k and random_j?
3. `intArray[0]` is initially 2, what it is the first value it is changed to?
4. When `i == 287`, what is `intArray[24]`?
5. What, if any, is the first repeated value for `intArray[0]`?
6. This code has a serious flaw, what is it? (No screenshot necessary)
